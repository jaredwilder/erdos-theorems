Erdős 477, P0 promotion (GPT gold pack rank 3, audited 2026-09-01; kernel round 2026-09-02).
Natural slice f(k) = k²: there is no A ⊆ ℤ such that every integer is uniquely a + k².
B - B for B = {k²} is exactly {m : m ≢ 2 mod 4}; uniqueness forces every nonzero difference
inside A to be ≡ 2 mod 4, so |A| ≤ 2; a finite A plus nonnegative squares is bounded below.
